            <p>Bachelor Science of Information - UX Design Track from University of Michigan- Ann Arbor.</p>

            <h2>My Passion</h2>
            <p>I'm very interested in the User UX/UI Research and Design field, which turned
                into obsession. I always try to understand how a website or product works and what could be done to
                make it better. As a user I understand how frustrating is to have a bad experience, and I believe
                that all users deserve an enjoyable and great experience, my goal is to be able to provide users
                with great experiences and make them happy.</p>
           
            <h2>Career Focus</h2>
            <p> In the future I would like to pursue a career in User Experience Design and Research where I can use
                my creativity and create beautiful, intuitive designs. I would like to be able to give back to
                community and country by creating and designing products that will improve our quality of life and
                addressing usersâ€™ needs by providing products or services that make task easier for them, my goal is
                to focus more on helping elderly people to enjoy the use of technology and benefit from technology.
